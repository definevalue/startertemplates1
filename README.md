# Start your project using this template

[Click to generate a project](https://github.com/workhard-finance/starter/generate)

# Install dependency

```shell
$ yarn
```

# Run tests

1. To run the tests, you should use hardhat's forking feature.
    * Go to alchemy & get API KEY.
    * Copy `.env.example` file and create your own `.env` file.
      ```shell
      $ cp .env.example .env
      ```
    * Replace `<key>` with your own API KEY.
      ```shell
      FORK_URL=https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>
      ```
    * Or you can use your own RPC server using geth. For example,
      ```shell
      $ geth --http.api "eth,net,web3" --http.addr localhost --http.port 8888

      #.env file
      FORK_URL=http://localhost:8888
      ```
2. Run the following command
    ```shell
    $ yarn test
    ```
